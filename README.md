## Project 0 for Harvard CS50â€™s Web Programming with Python and JavaScript.

Hello World!

This is my submission for project 0.

I have designed the exact user interface of Google Search, Google Image Search, and Google Advanced Search in this project.

This repository includes three HTML files for different pages: [Google Search](https://github.com/AmirhosseinSafari/project-0-cs50/blob/master/google_search.html), [Google Image Search](https://github.com/AmirhosseinSafari/project-0-cs50/blob/master/google_image_search.html), and [Google Advance Search](https://github.com/AmirhosseinSafari/project-0-cs50/blob/master/google_advance_search.html), and you can find their distinct style sheets are in the 'styles' directory. 
The "assets" directory also contains Google's logo.

I hope you enjoy it. :)
